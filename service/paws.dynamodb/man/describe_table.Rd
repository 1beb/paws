}
\details{
If you issue a \code{DescribeTable} request immediately after a \code{CreateTable} request, DynamoDB might return a \code{ResourceNotFoundException}. This is because \code{DescribeTable} uses an eventually consistent query, and the metadata for your table might not be available at that moment. Wait for a few seconds, and then try the \code{DescribeTable} request again.

# This example describes the Music table.
