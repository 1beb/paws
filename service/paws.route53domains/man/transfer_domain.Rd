\description{
This operation transfers a domain from another registrar to Amazon Route 53. When the transfer is complete, the domain is registered either with Amazon Registrar (for .com, .net, and .org domains) or with our registrar associate, Gandi (for all other TLDs).
}
\details{
For transfer requirements, a detailed procedure, and information about viewing the status of a domain transfer, see \href{http://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/domain-transfer-to-route-53.html}{Transferring Registration for a Domain to Amazon Route 53} in the \emph{Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide}.

If the registrar for your domain is also the DNS service provider for the domain, we highly recommend that you consider transferring your DNS service to Amazon Route 53 or to another DNS service provider before you transfer your registration. Some registrars provide free DNS service when you purchase a domain registration. When you transfer the registration, the previous registrar will not renew your domain registration and could end your DNS service at any time.

If the registrar for your domain is also the DNS service provider for the domain and you don't transfer DNS service to another provider, your website, email, and the web applications associated with the domain might become unavailable.

If the transfer is successful, this method returns an operation ID that you can use to track the progress and completion of the action. If the transfer doesn't complete successfully, the domain registrant will be notified by email.
