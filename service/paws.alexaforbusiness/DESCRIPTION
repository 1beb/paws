Description: Alexa for Business helps you use Alexa in your organization.
    Alexa for Business provides you with the tools to manage Alexa
    devices, enroll your users, and assign skills, at scale. You can build
    your own context-aware voice skills using the Alexa Skills Kit and the
    Alexa for Business API operations. You can also make these available
    as private skills for your organization. Alexa for Business makes it
    efficient to voice-enable your products and services, thus providing
    context-aware voice experiences for your customers. Device makers
    building with the Alexa Voice Service (AVS) can create fully
    integrated solutions, register their products with Alexa for Business,
    and manage them as shared devices in their organization.
