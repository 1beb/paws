Description: AWS Resource Groups lets you organize AWS resources
    such as Amazon EC2 instances, Amazon Relational Database Service
    databases, and Amazon S3 buckets into groups using criteria that you
    define as tags. A resource group is a collection of resources that
    match the resource types specified in a query, and share one or more
    tags or portions of tags. You can create a group of resources based on
    their roles in your cloud infrastructure, lifecycle stages, regions,
    application layers, or virtually any criteria. Resource groups enable
    you to automate management tasks, such as those in AWS Systems Manager
    Automation documents, on tag-related resources in AWS Systems Manager.
    Groups of tagged resources also let you quickly view a custom console
    in AWS Systems Manager that shows AWS Config compliance and other
    monitoring data about member resources.
