Description: Amazon Neptune is a fast, reliable, fully-managed graph
    database service that makes it easy to build and run applications that
    work with highly connected datasets. The core of Amazon Neptune is a
    purpose-built, high-performance graph database engine optimized for
    storing billions of relationships and querying the graph with
    milliseconds latency. Amazon Neptune supports popular graph models
    Property Graph and W3C\'s RDF, and their respective query languages
    Apache TinkerPop Gremlin and SPARQL, allowing you to easily build
    queries that efficiently navigate highly connected datasets. Neptune
    powers graph use cases such as recommendation engines, fraud
    detection, knowledge graphs, drug discovery, and network security.
