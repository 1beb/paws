\title{Modifies a subnet attribute}
\usage{
modify_subnet_attribute(SubnetId, AssignIpv6AddressOnCreation = NULL,
  MapPublicIpOnLaunch = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{SubnetId}{The ID of the subnet.}

\item{AssignIpv6AddressOnCreation}{Specify \code{true} to indicate that network interfaces created in the specified subnet should be assigned an IPv6 address. This includes a network interface that's created when launching an instance into the subnet (the instance therefore receives an IPv6 address).

If you enable the IPv6 addressing feature for your subnet, your network interface or instance only receives an IPv6 address if it's created using version \code{2016-11-15} or later of the Amazon EC2 API.}

\item{MapPublicIpOnLaunch}{Specify \code{true} to indicate that network interfaces created in the specified subnet should be assigned a public IPv4 address. This includes a network interface that's created when launching an instance into the subnet (the instance therefore receives a public IPv4 address).}
}
\description{
Modifies a subnet attribute. You can only modify one attribute at a time.
}
\examples{
# This example modifies the specified subnet so that all instances
# launched into this subnet are assigned a public IP address.
modify_subnet_attribute(
  MapPublicIpOnLaunch = list(
    Value = TRUE
  ),
  SubnetId = "subnet-1a2b3c4d"
)
