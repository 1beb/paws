\usage{
purchase_host_reservation(HostIdSet, OfferingId, ClientToken = NULL,
  CurrencyCode = NULL, LimitPrice = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{HostIdSet}{The IDs of the Dedicated Hosts with which the reservation will be associated.}

\item{OfferingId}{The ID of the offering.}

\item{ClientToken}{Unique, case-sensitive identifier you provide to ensure idempotency of the request. For more information, see \href{http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/Run_Instance_Idempotency.html}{How to Ensure Idempotency} in the \emph{Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide}.}

\item{CurrencyCode}{The currency in which the \code{totalUpfrontPrice}, \code{LimitPrice}, and \code{totalHourlyPrice} amounts are specified. At this time, the only supported currency is \code{USD}.}

\item{LimitPrice}{The specified limit is checked against the total upfront cost of the reservation (calculated as the offering's upfront cost multiplied by the host count). If the total upfront cost is greater than the specified price limit, the request fails. This is used to ensure that the purchase does not exceed the expected upfront cost of the purchase. At this time, the only supported currency is \code{USD}. For example, to indicate a limit price of USD 100, specify 100.00.}
